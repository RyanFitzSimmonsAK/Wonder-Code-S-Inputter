# Wonder Code S Inputter

This is a useful tool for people playing Pok√©mon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky (EoS) on an emulator.  Wonder Code S is a mechanic that allows players to make themselves missions to complete.  However, these "Wonder Codes" used to create the missions are time-consuming and tedious to input.  This tool does the inputs for the user extremely quickly.

# Usage

Download the project as a zip file, and unpack it.  Open it in your IDE of choice, and ensure pydirectinput is in your virtual environment.  Put the Wonder Code S in "code.txt".  Run main with DeSmuMe open, and quickly switch it to your top window.  Ensure your cursor is on 'N' to begin with.  

# Future

I plan on adding functionality for inputting multiple Wonder Code S codes in short succession.
